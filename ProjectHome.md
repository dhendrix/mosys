Mosys is a swiss army knife of system tools. It is intended to assist with bring-up, debugging, and support of platforms which often requires obscure and platform-specific knowledge. Examples include non-enumerable GPIO/I2C/SMBus device information, querying embedded controllers (ECs), EEPROM information, embedded data retrieval / decoding, and more. It is written in C (Linux kernel style) and can be used as a standalone program, linked into other programs, or as a diagnostic payload for firmware and bootloaders.

Mosys performs platform detection and contains platform-specific logic for obtaining data which can be processed using one of many libraries. Mosys uses the Linux kernel build system and can be built for multiple platforms/architectures or for a single target.

Mosys comes with a clean and intuitive hierarchical natural language syntax and outputs results in a unified manner. There are very few CLI flags to worry about or remember. Those present control basic program parameters such as output formatting and verbosity, but not platform-specific behavior. Data presentation is intended to be both human-readable and script-friendly. In general, everything is presented as simple key=value pairs, though a sysfs-like filesystem representation is planned. The command tree is built for each platform so that invalid/irrelevant commands cause mosys to exit gracefully and avoid clutter on the CLI.
