This is a haystack to test scanft() function. A few needles have been
thrown in to exercise edge case scenarios.

./ : contains needle0 which is trivial to find
dir1/ : contains needle1 and requires basic recursion to work
dir2/ : contains needle2 and requires basic symlink handling to work
dir3/ : tests that circular recursion won't crash scanft()
